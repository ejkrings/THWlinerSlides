ARDUINO UNO:

Install HighPowerStepperDriver.h through the Arduino IDE Library Manager before uploading code to microcontroller

GUI:

LinearSlideGUI.exe should work on any computer (including those without Python installed)
If .exe file does not work, the Python script for the GUI (THWstrainV3.py) can be run through any Python IDE (such as Spyder)
	Make sure THWstrainGUI_V3.py is in the same folder
	
PYTHON CODE:

The Python code shouldn't be needed, but feel free to make any changes. 
The ui file can be modified in the Qt Designer software if you want to make any changes to the GUI.
